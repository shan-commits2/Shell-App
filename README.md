## 🧠 What is `$ Sudo Shell`?

`$ Sudo Shell` is a lightweight and customizable command-line interface simulation made for developers, students, and tinkerers. It’s not a real system shell — instead, it’s a playground for building your own commands, experimenting with scripts, or adding silly, creative features.  
Use it for testing, education, roleplay hacking setups, or just to have a shell with personality.
